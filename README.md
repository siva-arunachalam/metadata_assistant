# Table Metadata Generator

This project demonstrates use of Large Language Model (LLM) to generate metadata for a given table. It presents a Streamlit user interface for selecting a table, generating metadata, and displaying the generated metadata for each column.

## Usage
1. Access the Streamlit app in your web browser at `http://localhost:8501`.
2. Select a table from the dropdown in the sidebar.
3. Choose an LLM model (GPT 3.5, GPT 4, or GPT 4o) from the radio buttons.
4. Click the "Generate Metadata" button to generate metadata for the selected table.
5. Once the metadata is generated, select a column from the dropdown to view its associated metadata (definition, data type, and sensitivity).
